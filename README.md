# Dev Stack

A React web app to explore frontend, backend, database, and tooling technologies, and build your own ideal development stack.

## Technologies Used

- React.js (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React-Toastify
- JSON (local data)

## Features

1. Browse 15+ technologies loaded from a JSON file, with category, difficulty, rating, and badge.
2. Add or remove technologies from a live "Your Stack" sidebar with duplicate prevention and toast notifications.
3. Fully responsive UI with a sticky navbar, two-tone gradient hero, and gradient brand theme.

## React Questions

1. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?
JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. React uses it because it makes components easier to read and write compared to using React.createElement manually.

2. What is the difference between props and state?
Props are data passed into a component from its parent and cannot be changed by the child. State is data managed inside a component that can change over time using useState.

3. What does the useState hook do, and where did you use it in this project?
useState lets a component remember and update values. I used it for technologies, stack, and loading in App.jsx to store the fetched data, the selected stack items, and the loading status.

4. What does the useEffect hook do, and why did you need it to load the JSON data?
useEffect runs side effects after render. I used it to fetch /technologies.json when the app first loads, then update state with the result.

5. Why does every item in a .map() list need a unique key prop
React uses keys to identify which items changed, were added, or removed. Without unique keys, React may re-render the wrong elements and cause bugs.

6. What is conditional rendering? Show one place you used it.
Conditional rendering means showing different UI based on a condition. I used it in YourStack.jsx to show an empty message when stack.length === 0, and the list of items otherwise.

7. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component, and how does a child send something back to the parent?
Data goes down via props . A child sends data back by calling a function prop provided by the parent
